His research spans from outdoor urban climate challenges to indoor air quality — from pollutant dispersion and thermal studies in urban areas to COVID-related indoor ventilation and aerosol dispersion studies. He is adept at large-scale numerical modelling in UNIX/Linux environments using ANSYS Fluent/OpenFOAM. He is passionate about addressing environmental health issues (e.g. contaminant exposure due to limited ventilation, urban overheating, and indoor/outdoor air quality) and supporting government and stakeholder policy and decision-making.","location":{"address":"De Zaale","postalCode":"5600 MB","city":"Eindhoven","countryCode":"The Netherlands","region":"North
