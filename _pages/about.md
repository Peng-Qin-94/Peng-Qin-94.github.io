<div style="text-align: justify;"> Dr. Peng Qin is a highly motivated researcher specializing in Building Physics, with a strong focus on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and its applications in public and environmental health. With a PhD from Eindhoven University of Technology (TUe) (the Netherlands), he has developed extensive expertise in modeling air quality, particle dispersion, and urban climate challenges. He is adept at using advanced computational tools like ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM and he has also led and participated in many high-impact projects. His work spans from addressing public health concerns, such as COVID-19 related indoor bioaerosol studies, to tackling urban environmental issues like pollutant dispersion and urban overheating. This dual-focus highlights a practical approach to research, aiming to support government policy and decision-making with robust data and simulations. He has also built an international profile and is part of various international scientific and organizing committees. He is member of the national research school for fluid mechanics in the Netherlands, the JM Burgerscentrum (JMBC), member of the Dutch-Flemish wind engineering association (KIVI section), member of the youth group of the Italian association for wind engineering (ANIV-G). He is also involved as assitant in COBEE2025 conference organization. He has published 7 ISI journal papers with 6 of them as the first author, being peer reviewer of over 10 ISI journals and attended 7 international conferences in wind engineering and urban physics topics. He is co-supervisor of 2 MSc and 2 PhD students at TUe.
