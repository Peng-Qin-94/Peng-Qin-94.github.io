**CLAIRE ("Clean Air for Everyone")**
A research project focused on using ventilation and air purification to minimize the impact of pandemics on our health and well-being.

**Key activities**
**Field Research:** Conducting experiments and qualitative studies in primary schools and nursing homes.
**Tool Development:** Creating new measurement methods and predictive risk models.
**Collaboration:** Working with industry and community partners to ensure innovations are practical and can be widely implemented.

Focusing on schools and nursing homes because improving air quality in these places offers a major opportunity to reduce the spread of viruses and microorganisms. This helps lower infections and maintain normalcy.

The benefits of CLAIRE's research go beyond pandemics, providing valuable knowledge for managing flu seasons and even offering preventative strategies for allergies and asthma.
