Work Package 3 (WP3) is dedicated to a rigorous analysis of how ventilation and air cleaning can limit the airborne transmission of infectious diseases, building upon the experimental and numerical data from WP2.

**Concept Assessment:**
Sub-projects WP3.1 and WP3.2 will evaluate advanced ventilation and air purification technologies. The primary aim is to maximize the reduction of both long- and short-range transmission while maintaining crucial factors like thermal comfort and energy efficiency. WP3.1 will concentrate on room-wide systems, while WP3.2 will examine localized solutions, with both efforts utilizing validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and physical experiments.

**Advanced Transmission Modeling:**
Sub-project WP3.3 will advance the state-of-the-art by incorporating time-dependent scenarios into transmission models. Using Lagrangian simulations, it will analyze how ventilation impacts exposure from the perspective of both the infected source and susceptible individuals, a dynamic often excluded from current models.

**Practical Application:**
The results from WP3 will provide critical input for WP4 (Use Cases) to ensure practical implementation and for WP5 (Strategies for Infection Control) to develop comprehensive strategies and guidelines against the spread of airborne respiratory diseases.
